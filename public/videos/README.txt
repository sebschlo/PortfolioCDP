For the 3D Gallery Project:

You need to place four video files here for the video mode:
1. wall-0.mp4 - Front wall video
2. wall-1.mp4 - Left wall video
3. wall-2.mp4 - Back wall video
4. wall-3.mp4 - Right wall video

These should be full-screen, high-quality videos of your gallery space.
For testing, you can use any MP4 videos and rename them accordingly.
