# Augmented Reality Experience

This augmented reality application allows users to virtually explore reconstructed heritage sites that have been damaged or lost. By combining historical research, photogrammetry, and AR technology, the experience creates an immersive window into the past.

## Features

- Historically accurate 3D reconstructions
- Location-based content unlocking
- Interactive information points
- Multi-language audio guides

## Development Process

The project required extensive collaboration with historians, archaeologists, and 3D artists to ensure accuracy while creating compelling experiences. We used a combination of:

- Archival photographs and documents
- Archaeological site data
- Oral histories from local communities
- Contemporary architectural analysis

## User Experience

The application is designed to work both on-site at the actual locations and remotely, providing different layers of information depending on the user's context. When used on-site, the AR overlays directly on the physical remains, creating a powerful temporal juxtaposition.

## Recognition

This project received the Cultural Heritage Innovation Award in 2022 and has been featured in several museum exhibitions exploring technology in historical preservation.
