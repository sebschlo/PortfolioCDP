## AI is one step ahead of you!

I trained a machine learning model with my Google Maps GPS track history, trying to understand how accurately it might predict my next move. If you click on the map, it will predict what my destination would be if a trip were to start there.

[View Interactive Experience by clicking here and scrolling to the end of the section.](https://gsapp-cdp.github.io/colloquium-1-2024/work/sebastian-schloesser/#ethical-predictions) On the map, you can click and observe where the route is predicted based on inference from my trained model.

## Intentional Subliminal Exposure 

This is a dataset of billboards and signage I found, geolocated and annotated [^1]. It was created so that one day augmented reality ad-blockers may be developed. I am using it to explore the subconscious messaging that lingers in the mind after driving by all these impressions. I then merged this data with a navigation network such that routes can be optimized for a particular set of imagery.
