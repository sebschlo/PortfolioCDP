Throughout my time at GSAPP, I have explored web technologies and their ability to communicate spatial concepts. My previous [portfolio site](https://sebs.gallery) was created with simple full screen video HTML elements. For this portfolio, I've incorporated a three.js virtual environment giving real 3D rendering functionality.

In the summer colloquium, I also explored scroll animations and storytelling using the [GSAP Library](https://gsap.com/), GLTF animated objects by using Blender, leaflet and MapBox for interactive maps, and tied it all together using React. You can see the results on the [Colloquium I Archive](https://gsapp-cdp.github.io/colloquium-1-2024/work/sebastian-schloesser/), where I begin exploring what Computational Design means to me, and what types of practice I wanted to develop.
