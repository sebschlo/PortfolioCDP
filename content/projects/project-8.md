# Digital Landscape

This piece explores the intersection of algorithmic art and natural landscapes. It uses procedural generation techniques to create an ever-evolving digital terrain that responds to environmental data.

## Technology Used

- WebGL
- Custom shader programming
- Live weather data API
- Procedural noise algorithms

## Concept

The landscape morphs and changes based on real-time weather patterns from various locations around the world. The colors, terrain shapes, and atmospheric effects all shift gradually to reflect these changing conditions.

Each viewing of the piece is unique, creating a dynamic representation of our constantly changing planet. The work questions the boundaries between natural and digital environments in an age of climate monitoring and satellite imagery.

## Process Documentation

The development process involved extensive experimentation with different noise algorithms and weather data mappings to find combinations that produced both aesthetically interesting and conceptually meaningful results.
