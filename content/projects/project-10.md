# Interactive Installation

This interactive installation combines light, sound, and motion sensors to create an immersive environment that responds to audience movement. As visitors move through the space, their presence triggers changes in the lighting and soundscape.

## Technology

- Custom motion sensors
- Programmable LED arrays
- Spatial audio system
- Real-time data processing

## Process

The development of this installation involved close collaboration with sound designers and electrical engineers. We began with a series of prototypes testing different sensor configurations and response patterns.

The final piece uses a network of 24 motion sensors and 64 independently addressable light sources to create a fluid, organic response to human movement.
