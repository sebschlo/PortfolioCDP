This project explores how subconscious bias can affect important decisions automated by AI. 

In the interactive experience, webcam eye tracking observes which characters you spend more time looking at, which skews the AI's preferences. Later, you are presented with a series of Trolley Problem difficult decisions to made, and in the end you can compare how you rationally decided compared with what your subconsciously trained AI decided.
