# Cellular Disturbance

## Sebastian Schloesser

### Description
Manifesting the presence and severity of cell phone distraction
through the physical mediums of water and light. This lamp consists of
a bulb placed under a bowl of water which can become disturbed with a
stepper motor when the presence of a compatible phone is detected,
projecting ripples on the walls and roof of the room. The phone will
communicate screen time to the lamp, which in turn will disturb the
water more vigorously the higher the reported screen time.

### Attentional Theory
I believe attention needs to be cultivated continously in life. It
does not suffice to do the occasional quick meditation to reign it in.
It is a persistent state of mind that ebbs and flows over longer time
periods. The largest enemy of the slow process of sharpening attention
is the phone, presenting an infinite void of distraction, an enabler
to avoiding the hard work of settling the mind. This intervention aims
to create ambient awareness of how much the phone has been used in a
day, and therefore how much effort needs to be placed to counteract
its effects. The higher the screen time, the more disturbed the
ripples projected on the walls. This number can only be brought down
through minutes of logged meditation time. In this way the lamp both
helps visualize the current state of the mind, but also serves as a
motivator to calm it down. The alternative is to bring the phone far
away from it, therefore eliminating the source of distraction
altogether. Finally the light ripples will dissipate from the walls.
While the effect could be entertaining and amusing at first,
eventually they will become a disturbance themselves onto the peace of
the room, giving the disturbance of the mind an embodied
manifestation. Placing this lamp in the bedroom would encourage a
habit of keeping the phone out completely, or of regularly meditating.
Through this repeated practice, attention will be tuned, like a guitar
out of pitch oscillating chaotically at the wrong frequencies. The
tool does not aim to fix attention in the short term, but rather to
encourage continuous practice that will focus it on the long term. By
undergoing this process, the participant will notice more in daily
life, in banal moments, and perhaps wonâ€™t immediately reach for the
phone as soon as a spare minute arises, but will rather contemplate
the present moment.>>
